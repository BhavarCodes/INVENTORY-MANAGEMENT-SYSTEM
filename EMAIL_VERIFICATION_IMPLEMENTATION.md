## 🔧 Configuration

### Development (No Email Service)
No configuration needed! Verification links appear in backend console:
```
📧 Email Verification Link (Copy this link):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
To: user@example.com
Link: http://localhost:3000/verify-email/abc123...
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### Production (With Email Service)
Add to `backend/.env`:
```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_SECURE=false
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
EMAIL_FROM=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_FROM_NAME=Grocery Inventory Management
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Registration & Verification
1. Start the application: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to registration page
3. Fill in the form and submit
4. Check backend console for verification link
5. Copy and paste link into browser
6. Verify email successfully
7. Try to log in - should work!

### Test Unverified Login
1. Register a new account
2. Try to log in WITHOUT verifying email
3. Should see error: "Please verify your email address before logging in..."
4. Verify email using link from console
5. Try to log in again - should work!

### Test Expired Token
1. Wait 24 hours after registration (or manually set expired date in DB)
2. Try to use verification link
3. Should see error about expired link
4. Use "Resend Verification Email" form
5. New link sent to console
6. Verify with new link - should work!

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Crypto Random Tokens**: 32-byte random hex strings (64 characters)
- **Time-Limited Tokens**: Expire after 24 hours
- **One-Time Use**: Token cleared after successful verification
- **No User Enumeration**: Resend endpoint doesn't reveal if email exists
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with salt rounds
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based auth after verification
- **HTTPS Ready**: All email links support HTTPS in production

## 📊 Database Schema Updates

```javascript
// User Model - New Fields
{
  isEmailVerified: {
    type: Boolean,
    default: false  // All new users start unverified
  },
  emailVerificationToken: {
    type: String  // 32-byte random hex
  },
  emailVerificationExpires: {
    type: Date  // 24 hours from creation
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

- [ ] Password reset functionality (email service already prepared)
- [ ] Email change verification (verify new email before updating)
- [ ] Account activation emails for admins
- [ ] Email notification preferences
- [ ] Multiple email templates for different actions
- [ ] Email delivery status tracking
- [ ] Bulk email capabilities for announcements

## 📝 Notes

- Google OAuth users bypass email verification (already verified by Google)
- Verification is only required for email/password registration
- Expired tokens can be regenerated by requesting new verification email
- All verification emails include both button link and plain text link
- Email templates are responsive and work on all devices
- Console fallback makes development easy without email configuration

## ✨ Summary

The email verification system is now fully functional and integrated into the registration and login flow. Users must verify their email before accessing the application, enhancing security and ensuring valid user contact information.
